I. Style for flexbox containers
    1. In flex system, style the layout according to the main axis and the cross axis,
    not horizontal and vertical axis

    2. if display is row, main axis is horizontal and cross axis is vertical
    if display if column, main axis is vertical and cross axis is horizontal

    3. if want to style individual items based on the main axis, use justify-content (default: flex-start)

    4. if want to style individual items based on the cross axis, use align-items (default: stretch)
    in order to center according to the cross axis, "align-items: center"

    5. align-content: This aligns a flex containerâ€™s lines 
    (so used when there are multi-lines in a flexbox container) 
    within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, 
    (very) similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.

II. Style for flexbox items
    1. use to override or apply flexible size to the items

    2. flex-shrink: the ability of an item to shrink (default: 1)
    if set to 0,  dont shrink at all

    3. flex-grow: defines the ability of items to grow when there is extra space
    If all items have flex-grow set to 1, 
    the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. 
    If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others

    4. flex-basis: This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed
